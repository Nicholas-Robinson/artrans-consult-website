        <h2>Behind the Name</h2>
        <p>Alan Robinson is the founder of ARTrans Consult. He brings four decades of experience. His initial twenty-eight years was in consultancy undertaking transport planning, traffic engineering, road infrastructure concept design, infrastructure funding and economic assessment and PPP advisory services providing traffic and revenue forecasts to either the bidding concessionaire or lender.</p>
        <p>This was followed by 11 years in the public sector rising to the South African National Roads Agency Ltd’s (SANRAL) National Network Panning Manager undertaking traffic forecasts, developing the national toll portfolio financial health model, managing PPP toll road concessions and other infrastructure projects.</p>
        <p>After officially “retiring” in March 2025, SANRAL has retained Alan on a part-time contract basis to continue chairing the National Concept Gateway Review committee for major projects, where he has saved the tax-payer approximately R2billion (±£90million) through value engineering; solving the cause of issues as opposed to providing infrastructure for the symptoms. He has also established and continues to develop in-house transport planning capacity within SANRAL through training and mentoring young engineers.</p>
